# cyclestats
Do you love cycling and also obsess about statistics? Then cyclestats is for you. 
cyclestats is intended to deliver the following three layers of functionality:

1) Acquire and parse sensor data of cycling tours from various sources (e.g. Garmin .fit, Strava API etc.)
2) Process the parsed data by generating various statistics, correlations etc.
3) Visually present the stats to the user
